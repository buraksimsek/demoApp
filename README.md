## Brokerage Service

This project is built using Spring Boot and Gradle. By default, when you build the project, Gradle will produce a JAR file under the “build/libs” folder named:
brokerage-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

``` 
This is because:  
- The root project name is set to “brokerage-service.”  
- The version is set to “1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.”  

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to build this project and package it as a Docker image.

---

## 1. Building with Gradle

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the project:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/brokerage-service
   ```
2. Clean and build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```
   This will run tests and create the “brokerage-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar” file in the “build/libs” folder.

3. Verify the JAR file:
   ```bash
   ls build/libs
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   brokerage-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

## 2. Creating a Docker Image

Below is a sample Dockerfile you can use. Make sure the COPY line points to the JAR file name that Gradle generated:

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the generated JAR into the container, naming it app.jar
COPY build/libs/brokerage-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app/app.jar"]
```

### Build the Docker Image
```
docker build -t brokerage-service .
``` 

### Run the Docker Container
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 brokerage-service
``` 
This binds your machine’s port 8080 to the container’s port 8080. Access the service using:
```
[http://localhost:8080]
```

## 3. Common Issues & Checks

- If you encounter “No such file or directory” or “Unable to access jarfile” errors, verify that:
    1. The file name in the Dockerfile’s COPY instruction exactly matches the JAR name generated by Gradle.
    2. The JAR was successfully built (check “build/libs” after running gradlew clean build).
    3. You’re in the correct directory when running your Docker build command.

---

## 4. Conclusion

By following these steps, you can:
1. Build your Spring Boot project with Gradle.
2. Verify the generated JAR file.
3. Create and run a Docker container with your application.
